    <p>In "Fiesta 1980", the Gender dynamics are very pronounced, with Papi portraying an aggressive man, and Mami a subservient woman. In addition to this, Papi has a mistress, whom he cheats on Mami with. Mami is described as being a follower of Papi, in fact, towards the end of the story Yunior comments that he could not image Mami without Papi. This highlights how Mami is far too reliant on Papi to be able to exercise her own agency, but is instead at the mercy of his decisions and choices. It is also noted in the short story how the men do not thank the women for cooking the food. Yunior even wonders if it is some kind of Dominican tradition that is being followed. In this short story, the women are depicted as typically oppressed, in being unrecognized and mistreated by their husbands who appear to control the family and their lives to a large extent. The experience of minority women during these immigration experiences is very important to note, as their struggles have often been ignored.</p>

    <p>	In "The Namesake", Ashima after marrying Ashoke must uproot her life and passion as a singer in India and follow Ashoke to America. It is a common theme in these migration stories of how women must follow their husbands, and put their husbands' needs way above their own. After arriving in America Ashima is very unnaturalized to her surroundings, and is seen to struggle emotionally with the change in her surroundings. Throughout the book, Ashima learns to cope with her surroundings, and after the untimely death of Ashoke, she learns how to manage by herself. Eventually, Ahima takes the decision not to live off her children, but to return to India and reignite her passion for singing and music. This transformation highlights how Ashima goes from a reliant housewife into taking agency over her own life. It is inspiring to see how through hardship she realizes that she must take control over her own life, and pursue her own passions.</p>
